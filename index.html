    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
    The softwarization of networks is enabled by the SDN (Software Defined Networking), NV (Network Virtualization), and NFV (Network Function Virtualization) paradigms, and offers many advantages and convenience for network operators, service providers and datacenter providers. By adopting network softwarization techniques, more and more novel network services and novel applications can be operated and deployed. Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a revolution for the development of futuristic network services and applications, especially in current 5G and future 6G networks. It is one of the hottest trends in technology. IoT is transforming our future by interconnecting everything: humans, vehicles, appliances, utilities, infrastructures, street lights and anything through an intelligent connection. The evolution of IoT has been progressively adopted by various organizations and industrial communities. In IoT environment, the huge amount of data and resources requested by various smart devices and humans can be collected and investigated in an intelligent manner in order to improvise the decision making. Hence, there exists a great need of managing these data and resources in an efficient manner.
    Given the strong interest in both industry and academia in the softwarization of telecommunication networks and cloud computing providers, this workshop aims at adopting network softwarization techniques for IoT applications. There are many interesting challenges currently requiring to be addressed by the research community, which aims at efficiently managing softwarized networks for IoT applications.
